# Core Design Principles
- It's impossible to get anything right for the first time, don't be afraid to rewrite it. Software is never written, it's always rewritten.
- KISS: keeps you focused, only solves problems we know about, fails less, easier to understand.
- YAGNI
- DRY: only one representation of a piece of knowledge for the entire product
- Forget ego and emotions when designing SW otherwise you don't focus on the problem and solution.
- Always have people review your code.
- When giving an advice, don't necessarily give the whole solution but only hints. Chances are that other people, using hints you gave them, can create different and better solution.
- Don't make decisions immediatelly, take some time to collect more information about the problem...then you can make better decisions.
- We want cohesive code have smaller pieces of well written code, couple things related, isolated unrelated
- Reduce coupling (don't interfere with previous note about cohesion)
- Single Responsibility Principle
  - Beware long methods: hard to test, read, reuse, optimize, change, lack cohesion, ...


# Dangerous people
- Who don't follow instructions.
- Who always follow instructions, literally.
